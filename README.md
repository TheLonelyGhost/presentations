# Public Speaking

This repository contains a smattering of slide decks and presentation material for any public speaking engagements I've done recently. It is intended as a central spot to link existing slide decks for my benefit and, in the name of operating in the open, the benefit of others too.

## Compiling a slide deck

```bash
~/workspace $ make && make http-serve
```
